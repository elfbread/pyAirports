Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/khaiid/most-crowded-airports

This project includes data for the most crowded airports around the world. The user selects a region of interest (from a list provided) and thep rogram auto-generates a line graph showing total number of passengers for airports in that region by year. Project includes a dictionary and a list, as well as a While loop.

For this project, you should utilize the Juypter Notebook add on to VS Code. 

Packages used:
* numPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib

Features used:
* Category 1: Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.

     * Used dictionary to assign "Region" to each observation
     * Used list to create values to check in while loop
      
* Category 2: Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application.

     * Imported CSV file
      
* Category 3: Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.

     * Line graph showing total number of passengers for selected region by year.

* Category 4:

     * PENDING

* Additional features:
  
     * Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.
     * Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
